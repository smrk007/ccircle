--- CONNECTION OBJECT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    connection.create() returns a connection object that you can use to send/receive messages to/from the game server

    The connection object has only one function of interest: .send.

        con.send( message_name [, message_data ]) -> Object

            Send a message to the game server. The return value depends on the message sent.

            message_name
                A string that identifies the type of message you're sending ot the server. You can see a full list
                of supported messages, along with their purpose and the data they take in / return out below

            message_data
                A dictionary of key, value pairs. The keys and values you provide will depend on the message that
                you're sending. Some messages don't require any data (like 'get_pos'), in which case you do not have
                to supply this argument at all.

    Example Usage:

        con.send('set_name', { 'name'='SuperJosh' })

            Sends a 'set_name' message to the server with one key-value pair: ('name', 'SuperJosh')

    Most of the functionality in your program will be sending messages to the server and interpreting the response.
