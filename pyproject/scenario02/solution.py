  --- ACCOUNT ------------------------------------------------------------------

    account.getBalance() -> Real Number

      Get the amount of money in your account

    account.getShares(sym) -> Integer

      Get the number of shares of the given stock that you currently own

  --- MARKET -------------------------------------------------------------------
